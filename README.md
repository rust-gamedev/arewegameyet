# README

## What is this?

The Rust community has a number of websites dedicated to keeping track of the state of the ecosystem for specific purposes. (e.g. [arewewebyet](https://www.arewewebyet.org) and [arewelearningyet](https://www.arewelearningyet.com))

This one tracks the state of the ecosystem for Game Development in Rust.

## Contribute

Arewegameyet? uses [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/), and [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) the Rust static site generator.

1. Navigate to whichever folder in `/content` best fits your project.

2. Edit that folder's `data.toml` file in any plain text editor or straight through [GitHub's editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

3. Create a new entry, following the schema described below. Note that all entries should be sorted alphabetically by the `name` field, ignoring case. There is a CI check to ensure this is done correctly - you can use the `sort_data.py` script to automatically fix a file.

**All done!** We do greatly appreciate PRs, but if you're not comfortable with this process, you're welcome to open an issue requesting the addition of your project instead.

### Schema

```toml
[[items]]
# The name of the item. Mandatory.
name = "My crate" 

# A short description of the item. Optional, but recommended.
description = "My extremely cool Rust crate" 

# The categories that your item should be assigned to. Mandatory.
categories = ["2drendering", "engines"]

# An image representing the item. Files should be checked in to
# /static/assets/img/, and the path should be absolute.
# Optional, but highly recommended for games!.
image = "/assets/img/logo.png"

# A link to the item's page on Crates.io. Optional.
crate_url = "https://crates.io/crates/mycrate"

# A link to the item's VCS repository. Optional.
repository_url = "https://github.com/username/repo"

# A link to the item's homepage. Optional.
homepage_url = "https://mycrate.com"

# A link to the item's Gitter chat. Optional.
gitter_url = "https://gitter.im/mycrate"
```

You can also tell the site to pull data directly from an external source:

```toml
[[items]]
# Pull data from Crates.io:
name = "mycratename"
source = "crates"
categories = ["mycategory"]

[[items]]
# Pull data from GitHub:
name = "username/repo"
source = "github"
categories = ["mycategory"]
```

Extra keys can be added to items that are pulled from external data (e.g. to add a homepage URL, or override some of the fetched data).

### Enhance this website

If you're comfortable with semantic-ui and Zola please reach out to us in the Issues with your enhancement ideas or just to state your willingness to contribute.

### Errors

It's very likely there are mistakes around, if you find one please file an issue.

*Thanks for helping us map the Rust game development ecosystem!*
